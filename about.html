    the founders of The Grind Cafe. Living in a small town, there aren't many places to go or things to do. When 
    our local coffee shop closed down, we knew we wanted to be the ones to help refill this void that came with
    our brewing passion for coffee. We pondered the idea for a few months, but with hearing many saddened complaints 
    around the community, we jumped right in and havenâ€™t looked back since.</p>
