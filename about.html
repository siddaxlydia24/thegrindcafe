We are Siddalee Kliewer and Lydia Jahnke, 
the founders of The Grind Cafe. Living in a small town, 
there aren't many places to go or things to do.
When our local coffee shop closed down, we knew 
we wanted to be the ones to help refill this void
that came with our brewing passion for coffee. 
We pondered the idea for a few months, but with 
hearing many saddened complaints around the community, 
we jumped right in and havenâ€™t looked back since.
